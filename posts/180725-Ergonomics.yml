I work two jobs one as a Night Auditor and another as a building manager for a small complex. If you don't know about these positions let me fill you in, you don't do much until you need to. Like we're talking about days where I wake up, fuck around go to work, fuck around, run some reports, fuck around, go to bed and get paid. Seems decent right?

Here's the shitty part: My building is small one bedrooms, my workplace was designed after the Iron Maiden oh and I'm fucking 6'4" with a crap spine. By this point in my life I've learned yoga to stretch everything properly and counter-flex (or whatever) my sore spots, multiple finger exercises and developed one hell of a love of my foam roller.

Only recently did I install a proper desk (beats the couch laptop), get a super high backed chair, decent mech keyboard, and a trackball. I'm still using a TV as a monitor but y'know what? For staring at shells all day, it works (until I can pick up a little Intel NUC). The trackball is the saving grace as I've been having some gross RSI symptoms. The heart of the system is still that shitty laptop, but I can use it for a few hours at a time and not want to off myself. That's the important part, it's comfortable for my build and needs but changeable for the girlfriend to play The Sims or whatever the fuck. To the rest of my friends it looks like a home for a neck-bearded giraffe, and with the Solarized theme slapped on everything to protect my retinas, I'm inclined to agree.

I'm jealous of one of my friends, he works as a 911 operator pulling 12 hour night shifts. Fucker has a sit-stand desk, lean bar, ergo mice, decent keyboards, light-sensitive monitors the whole 9. It's comfortable and he's not fighting his environment. My workplace, on the other hand, was built for the shortest-common-denominator. Hell, I can pull the [Riker Maneouver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIGhYMwRgs) on most of the furniture. The desk comes up to just below my crotch, no space to slide your legs under said desk, the chair doesn't adjust enough to use the surface, feet get cramped behind a printer and there is a nasty 45deg twist to use the monitors. In short: It sucks and I can't get much work done because I'm moving around every 30minutes to stretch.

Just the contrast between the two is insane and I just picked up full-time hours here, So I need a coping mechanism and quick. Enter the [Unicomp Trackball](http://www.pckeyboard.com/page/category/ClassicTrackball), It's a keyboard, It's a mouse it's an ugly beige freak of nature with buckling springs. But it's large enough to sit in my lap on a phonebook and avoid most of the problems with sitting here. So that's cool. But what's my ideal ergo set up?

For this one, I'm going to turn to the 40 dudes that watch football all day and take it to the logical extreme. The humble Lazy Boy. Great for sitting on for days at a time, sleeping and just about everything else, the Lazy Boy has been a staple in divorced men's homes since it's conception in 1927. So it's going to be the framework for my ideal lazy-station. Keyboards are a bad time with this, so we're going to just go with a [Data Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrRWTeJ0-Ow) sunk into the armrests with an [Elecom Huge](https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g6-M01-AD-FD-rBVaSFq9536AHTLwAAOdcYs0sqI563.jpg/authentic-japan-elecom-huge-trackball-wireless.jpg) on the side, maybe a mount for the optional foot pedal of the DH. How do we do monitors? In a fixed position adjusting our posture is going to mess with the angle of view so we need something relative to position, either a fixed arm or two on her or a skip it and go with a full blown AR/VR mount. Hardware can be stashed under the chair itself (seal the venting for a heated seat in winter) and you can fit a miniATX under there easy. [Pretty much what this guy did](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6kg0j8/the_ultimate_lazy_pc_gamer_setup_from/) but cleaner.

Upon further research, for about 10Grand you can build your own [HACKER CONTAINMENT CUBE](http://www.mwelab.com/en/emperor.html). This is disturbing and will take time to process.
