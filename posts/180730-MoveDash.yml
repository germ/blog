I've been doing some thinking on what it is about Tumblr that I actually hate, turns out it's all the goddamn reposts and gifs. Good news, theres a way to filter those out!

I'm nostalgic for  early 2000s blogging (such as jwz.org & livejournal) where content was not easily repostable. This led itself to be more of a screaming-at-the-void type of platform that encouraged making connections and actually showcasing yourself. I care about you, not what you like.

Tumblr (and a good chunk of social media today) is more about presenting content that fits your personality, it's stuff that you enjoy not self generated. This type of content still exists here but is buried by a mountain of quick-style shares on your dash. Quite frankly it's fucking disgusting.

The wonderful devs of [xKit](https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit) made a browser extension that modifies a whack-a-fuckload of tumblr features and supports creating your own extensions. It's fantastic! and after enabling the "Show originals" & Filter GIFs extensions my dash is filled with all sorts of whingy text posts. Turns out it's a little hard to create your own images to post, so most just reblog inane crap. But after a few pages of text you hit the bottom of your feed, that's how little there is.

So yeah I'm scouring Tumblr for text blogs now, life is good.
